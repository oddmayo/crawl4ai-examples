# crawl4ai scraping

Use of crawl4AI with and without local LLMs. There are plenty of tutorials on how to use this great open source web crawler, unfortunately not many on the specific use of LLMs for lazy crawling.

Despite this the official library docs provide great examples on how to achieve this, even if they focus mainly on API services.

In this repo I'll keep solid examples on how to use it for multiple escenarios.
